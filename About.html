Hi, my name is Duane Roberts, and I am the owner of Acuma Tech. I am 21 years old, and I was born in Atlanta Gerogia.

I am currently a student attending Wake Tech Community College, and I am pursiung a degree in Web Development. Technology has always been a big part of my life. This is honestly what sparked me to choose this area of study. I know the journey will have bumps in the road, but in the end, it will be well worth it. I was always taught growing up to never quit on your dreams, and to keep chasing after them.
